# Electrical and Computer Engineer

##### PROFILE
I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, holding a 5-year bachelor’s degree with emphasis in digital systems, control, and automation. My main interests are computer science, robotics and digital systems. I worked at Schneider electric for 4 years as a Service Engineer, developing hardware and software solutions for Industrial automation implementations. Currently, I am on my third year of the Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD program at the University of Delaware, and I work as a researcher at CAPSL, the Computer Architecture and Parallel Systems Laboratory. 

##### EDUCATION
* **PhD Student & Research Assistant, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware**

January 2019 – Present

* **B.Sc. Electronic Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana**

January 2008 –November 2013

##### RESEARCH INTERESTS
My research is currently focused in Parallel and High-Performance Computing (HPC): architectures, programming models, and compilers. Developing program execution model (PXM) implementations based on the Codelet Model that has strong foundations on Dataflow theory. I work extending our current runtime implementation to create a distributed version of the runtime (DECARD) that can be used in multi-node distributed memory architectures. The runtime includes a control scheme to achieve a target performance, precision, or energy consumption, this a key topic for the next generation of computer systems. My work also includes designing, 3D modeling, 3D printing, and assembling a Beowulf Cluster (DEMAC) using Parallella boards.

My previous research was focused on bio-inspired robots; I worked with Lola-OP™ at KM-RoBoTa, which is a modular snake robot. I created a mathematical model to describe the robot’s structure and interaction with the terrain to perform a stability analysis based on the multi-body kinematic formulation. I would like to use the knowledge and skills acquired in large computational systems towards the development of novel robotic platforms and applications.
